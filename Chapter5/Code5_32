gnuplot \textgreater help
 'Gnuplot' is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2,
 MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted
 but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally
 created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions
 and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses
 such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party
 applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active
 development since 1986.
